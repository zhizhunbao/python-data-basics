# Business Goals and Data Understanding

## Overview

The success of data analysis projects often depends on accurately defining business objectives. This module will learn how to transform vague business requirements into specific data analysis goals, laying the foundation for subsequent data processing and analysis work.

## Business Goal Setting Example

Learn how to transform business requirements into data analysis goals through practical cases:

```python
# Business goal setting example
# An e-commerce platform wants to improve user purchase conversion rate

# 1. Business requirement analysis
business_need = "Improve user purchase conversion rate"
current_rate = 2.5  # Current conversion rate
target_rate = 4.0   # Target conversion rate

# 2. Transform into data questions
data_questions = [
    "What factors influence user purchase decisions?",
    "What are the characteristics of user behavior patterns?",
    "How to predict user purchase probability?"
]

# 3. Set analysis goals
analysis_goals = {
    "Identify key factors": "Find main variables affecting purchase decisions",
    "User segmentation": "Segment users based on behavioral characteristics",
    "Prediction model": "Build purchase probability prediction model"
}

print(f"Business need: {business_need}")
print(f"Current conversion rate: {current_rate}%")
print(f"Target conversion rate: {target_rate}%")
print("\nData questions:")
for i, question in enumerate(data_questions, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {question}")
```

## Learning Objectives

Through this module, you will be able to:

- **Clarify Business Goals**: Learn to transform vague business requirements into specific data analysis goals
- **Understand Data Nature**: Master systematic methods for data exploration and understanding
- **Define Problem Framework**: Establish clear problem definition and solution approaches
- **Develop Analysis Strategy**: Lay the foundation for subsequent data processing and analysis work

## Core Content

### 1. Business Goal Setting

The success of data analysis projects often depends on accurately defining business objectives. We will learn:

- How to identify and analyze business requirements
- Transform business problems into data problems
- Set measurable analysis goals
- Establish project success criteria

### 2. Data Understanding and Exploration

Before starting analysis, deep understanding of data is essential:

- Data quality assessment
- Data distribution characteristic analysis
- Variable relationship exploration
- Data preprocessing requirement identification

### 3. Problem Definition Framework

Establish systematic problem definition methods:

- Problem classification and prioritization
- Hypothesis establishment and validation
- Analysis scope definition
- Expected result planning

## Practice Case

We will demonstrate how to:

1. **Business Background**: An e-commerce platform wants to improve user purchase conversion rate
2. **Goal Setting**: Identify key factors affecting user purchase decisions
3. **Data Understanding**: Analyze user behavior data and product feature data
4. **Problem Definition**: Build user purchase behavior prediction model

## E-commerce User Behavior Data Example

| User ID | Visit Duration | Page Views | Purchased | Purchase Amount |
|---------|----------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| U001    | 15 minutes     | 8          | Yes       | 299             |
| U002    | 3 minutes      | 2          | No        | 0               |
| U003    | 25 minutes     | 12         | Yes       | 599             |
| U004    | 8 minutes      | 5          | No        | 0               |
| U005    | 12 minutes     | 7          | Yes       | 199             |
