# Data Processing Tools Comparison

## Overview

Choosing the right tools is crucial in data analysis projects. This module will provide an in-depth comparison of the three most commonly used data processing tools in Python: List, NumPy, and Pandas, helping you select the best tool for your specific needs.

## Tool Performance Comparison Example

Learn about the performance differences between the three tools through practical code examples:

```python
import time
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Create test data
size = 1000000
data = list(range(size))

# 1. List processing
start_time = time.time()
list_result = [x * 2 for x in data if x % 2 == 0]
list_time = time.time() - start_time

# 2. NumPy processing
np_data = np.array(data)
start_time = time.time()
np_result = np_data[np_data % 2 == 0] * 2
np_time = time.time() - start_time

# 3. Pandas processing
df = pd.DataFrame({'value': data})
start_time = time.time()
pandas_result = df[df['value'] % 2 == 0]['value'] * 2
pandas_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f"List processing time: {list_time:.4f} seconds")
print(f"NumPy processing time: {np_time:.4f} seconds")
print(f"Pandas processing time: {pandas_time:.4f} seconds")
print(f"\nResult count: {len(list_result)}")
```

## Practice Case

We will demonstrate how to use the three tools through a complete sales data analysis case:

1. **Data Loading**: Use different tools to read sales data CSV files
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and abnormal data
3. **Data Analysis**: Calculate sales statistical indicators
4. **Result Presentation**: Generate analysis reports and visualizations

## Sales Data Example

| Date | Product | Sales | Unit Price | Revenue |
|------|---------|-------|------------|---------|
| 2024-01-01 | Laptop | 15 | 5999 | 89985 |
| 2024-01-02 | Phone | 32 | 3999 | 127968 |
| 2024-01-03 | Tablet | 8 | 2999 | 23992 |
| 2024-01-04 | Laptop | 22 | 5999 | 131978 |
| 2024-01-05 | Phone | 28 | 3999 | 111972 |

## CSV Data Processing Example

```python
# CSV data processing example
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Read CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Data cleaning
df = df.dropna()  # Remove missing values
df = df[df['Sales'] > 0]  # Filter abnormal data

# Data analysis
total_sales = df['Revenue'].sum()
avg_price = df['Unit Price'].mean()
top_product = df.groupby('Product')['Sales'].sum().idxmax()

print(f"Total sales: {total_sales:,}")
print(f"Average unit price: {avg_price:.2f}")
print(f"Top-selling product: {top_product}")
```
